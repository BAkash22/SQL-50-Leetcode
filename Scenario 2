question , from orders table it contains a column called order date where u need to find the number of orders happened by 
month for only selected years such as 2002,2003,2006. Display month and orders count.

SELECT 
    YEAR(order_date) AS year,
    CASE 
        WHEN MONTH(order_date) = 1 THEN 'January'
        WHEN MONTH(order_date) = 2 THEN 'February'
        WHEN MONTH(order_date) = 3 THEN 'March'
        WHEN MONTH(order_date) = 4 THEN 'April'
        WHEN MONTH(order_date) = 5 THEN 'May'
        WHEN MONTH(order_date) = 6 THEN 'June'
        WHEN MONTH(order_date) = 7 THEN 'July'
        WHEN MONTH(order_date) = 8 THEN 'August'
        WHEN MONTH(order_date) = 9 THEN 'September'
        WHEN MONTH(order_date) = 10 THEN 'October'
        WHEN MONTH(order_date) = 11 THEN 'November'
        WHEN MONTH(order_date) = 12 THEN 'December'
    END AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM 
    orders
WHERE 
    YEAR(order_date) IN (2002, 2003, 2006)
GROUP BY 
    YEAR(order_date), 
    MONTH(order_date)
ORDER BY 
    YEAR(order_date), 
    MONTH(order_date);
